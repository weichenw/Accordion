 * conductors/in-process/agedSummaryConductor.ts — shared base for the "aged region → one LLM-written
 * summary group" conductor shape, factored out of `compaction-naive/compaction-naive.ts` and
 * `handoff/handoff.ts` (PR #82 adversarial review: the two were ~90% duplicated — same
 * agedRegion/foreignGroupedIds/emit-group/launch-completion machinery and the same output-token
 * reservation block, and the duplication had already drifted: the two bugs fixed here (no
 * prompt-injection neutralizer in compaction-naive; user blocks silently swallowed into a
 * non-recoverable group despite a "verbatim" promise) existed in one sibling but not the other).
 *
 * `AgedSummaryConductor` owns everything that was byte-identical (or identical modulo a field
 * name) between the two: the aged-region derivation, foreign-grouped-id exclusion, the per-run
 * group-emission walk, the completion launch/inflight/attempt-key/sticky-failure-status lifecycle
 * (now including link-unavailability classification, see `isUnavailableError` below), the
 * output-token reservation math (MAX/MIN/MARGIN), and the `<conversation>`/`<prior-tag>` prompt
 * template with its prompt-injection neutralizer. A subclass supplies only what is genuinely
 * different: its system prompt, its two prompt instructions (first-pass / recursive), its
 * count-preamble format, and its four status messages (empty-output / window-too-tight / reject /
 * unavailable). `includeInGroup` (below) is an optional per-kind fold-eligibility hook a subclass
 * MAY override — neither shipped subclass does today (both `compaction-naive` and `handoff`
 * swallow every kind, including `user`, matching main's original behavior byte-for-byte), but the
 * hook stays available for a future conductor that genuinely needs to exclude a kind.
 *
 * No Svelte, no `$state`, no engine imports. Types only from `../conductor/contract` and

	/**
	 * Build the user-role prompt for the completion. The format spec lives in `systemPrompt`
	 * (identical for both passes); this only varies the input wrapper and the one-line mode
	 * preamble, both supplied by the subclass.
	 *
	 * FIRST round (`text == null`): `<conversation>` … `</conversation>` + `firstPassInstruction()`.
	 * Every newly-aged block is included verbatim (all kinds, labeled by role/kind) — INCLUDING
	 * kinds `includeInGroup` would later exclude from the fold, since they are still valid CONTEXT
	 * for the model even when they must stay live on the wire.
	 *
	 * RECURSIVE round (`text != null`): `<${priorTag}>` … `</${priorTag}>` + `<conversation>` …
	 * `</conversation>` + `recursiveInstruction()`. The originals already fed into a prior round are
	 * deliberately not re-read (recursive amnesia by design for the assistant/tool/thinking content
	 * that DID get folded away; see each subclass for why).
	 *
	 * INJECTION DEFENSE: block text, block labels, and the prior round's text are all interpolated
	 * inside `<conversation>` / `<${priorTag}>` tags. A tool_result carrying a literal closing tag
	 * (a web fetch or file read — attacker-influenceable) would otherwise break out of the data
	 * section and inject instructions into the completion call. `neutralize` breaks any such
	 * closing tag in interpolated content; `systemPrompt` is expected to declare everything inside
	 * those tags untrusted data, never instructions.
