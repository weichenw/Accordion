/*
 * digest.ts — what a folded block collapses to.
 *
 * Deterministic, per-kind. The point of typed blocks is that each kind keeps a
 * different essence when folded: a tool_call keeps WHAT it did, a tool_result
 * keeps only its shape and a taste of WHAT it saw. No LLM here yet — these are
 * structured digests so behaviour is reproducible and debuggable.
 *
 * Every digest carries a leading `{#<code> FOLDED}` tag. This is the engine's
 * source-of-truth string: it is what the GUI renders for a folded block, what
 * `digestTokens` counts, AND (in live mode) the exact text the agent receives in
 * place of the folded content. The agent reads the short `code` from the tag and
 * calls the `unfold` tool with it to pull the block back to full content. Keeping the
 * tag here — not bolted on at the wire — guarantees the GUI shows precisely what the
 * model sees and the saved-tokens figure includes the tag's real cost.
 *
 * The code is a short HASH of the durable block id, not the id itself: a raw id is a
 * UUID/timestamp (`a:f2965ed9-…-d93e8c55c59e:p0`) — unreadable line-noise repeated on
 * every folded block. The hash is a pure function of the id, so it needs no state and
 * is globally stable (same block → same code, every session). A 6-char base36 space
 * (~2.2B) keeps collisions rare; the rare collision is handled by `resolveUnfold`
 * unfolding every folded block that shares the code (cheap and harmless).

 * `{#code FOLDED}` tag — so the agent is never shown a handle for a block it can't

/**
 * The ONE foldability predicate, shared by the view and the wire. A block may be folded —
 * its content substituted by a digest on the agent's wire — iff its KIND is foldable. This
 * is the single gate `store.fold()` / `store.substOne()` / `store.canFold()` AND the wire
 * (`computeFoldOps` / `resolveUnfold`) all consult, so the screen can NEVER show a per-block
 * fold the wire would refuse. That refusal is the "UI lie" this predicate exists to make impossible: a folded
 * `tool_call` whose tile recesses and whose tokens are counted as saved, while the agent
 * still receives the block whole.
 *
 * KIND ONLY — deliberately content- and id-independent. The durable-id guard (`isDurableId`)
 * is a LIVE-WIRE EMIT concern, NOT part of foldability: the on-disk / demo / Claude Code parse
 * assigns non-durable ids (`<eventId>:p<j>`), and those read-only sessions must still fold by
 * kind in every mode (preview === steering — see CLAUDE.md). So durable-id stays where it
 * belongs, inside `computeFoldOps`, and is intentionally not mirrored here. Group collapse
 * (ADR 0006) is a SEPARATE mechanism — structural whole-message removal with its own rules —
 * and may legitimately include `tool_call`/`user`; this predicate governs only per-block
 * content folding, never group collapse.

 * for a block's lifetime, yet `refold()` recomputes it twice per fold candidate and every
 * `liveTokens` read recomputes it per folded block; each call re-runs the FNV hash plus a
 * couple of text splits. A WeakMap keyed by the block makes those repeats free and is
 * GC-friendly (no cross-session leak: the entry dies with the block).
 *
 * TRIPWIRE: there is no invalidation. This is sound ONLY because a committed block's content
 * fields are never mutated in place (the live resend path drops duplicate ids rather than
 * overwriting; applyPlan clones). If a future feature ever mutates an existing block's
 * `text`/`tokens` (e.g. streaming partial-text growth into a committed block), it MUST clear
