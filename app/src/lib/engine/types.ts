 * references a CONTIGUOUS, non-overlapping run of member blocks (by id) that the human
 * collapses into a single tile. `folded` is the group's own state, orthogonal to each
 * member's per-block override — folding the group collapses the range; unfolding it
 * returns the members to their own fold state. The id is `g:<firstMemberDurableId>`; its
 * agent-unfold handle is `foldCode(id)`. Invariants (enforced at creation, store.createGroup):
 * contiguous · non-overlapping · flat (members are blocks, never groups) · ≥1 member
 * (relaxed from ≥2 so a lone block can be dropped/summarized — must still collapse at least
 * one member, i.e. not be all-stragglers) · entirely older than the protected tail.
 * `memberIds` is in conversation (block) order.
 *
 * `by` is provenance: who created the group. Today every group is human-created (`by:"you"`);
 * the field is kept (dormant, like `Block.autoFolded`) for the auto-grouping the conductor
 * redesign will reintroduce. Optional only so legacy / test-constructed literals stay valid;
