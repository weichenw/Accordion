/*
 * protocol.ts — the wire contract between the pi extension and the Accordion GUI.
 *
 * This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the live link. It is imported by
 * both the GUI (app/src/lib/live/*) and the pi extension (extension/accordion.ts,
 * via a relative import) so the two can never drift. Keep it dependency-free and
 * types-only at runtime — no imports from the rest of the app.
 *
 * ── Roles (Milestone 1) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   • The pi EXTENSION hosts a WebSocket server on PORT (127.0.0.1).
 *   • The GUI webview connects as a WebSocket CLIENT.
 *   • "GUI drives, extension is thin": the extension never decides what to fold.
 *     It linearizes pi's in-memory messages into blocks, streams them, and applies
 *     whatever fold plan the GUI returns. The GUI runs the engine (the brain).
 *
 * ── Per-turn loop ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. pi's `context` hook fires in the extension (before a model call).
 *   2. Extension sends `sync` with the blocks added since the last sync.
 *   3. GUI updates its live store, runs the engine, replies `plan { ops }`.
 *   4. Extension applies the ops to the real messages and returns them to pi.
 *      If no GUI is connected, the reply times out with no cached plan, or the
 *      GUI's view was superseded mid-wait, the extension passes the messages
 *      through UNMODIFIED (never corrupts context). A timeout WITH a cached plan
 *      re-applies that last-known plan instead of shipping raw (issue #58). Every
 *      one of these outcomes — including success — is counted and, where a client
 *      is reachable, acked back as a `passthrough` message (issue #60, ADR 0020) so
 *      the GUI (and the bellows bench rig polling `/__accordion/meta`) can see what
 *      actually rode the wire instead of inferring it from silence.
 *
 * Milestone 1 deliberately ships an EMPTY plan (`ops: []`) from the GUI: the loop
 * is proven end-to-end while never altering a single model call.
 */

/**
 * Bump on any breaking change to the message shapes below. History:
 *  - v4: group collapse ops (`GroupOp`, `PlanMessage.groups`).
 *  - v5: recall tool (`recallRequest` / `recallResult`) plus completion relay
 *        (`completeRequest` / `completeResult`) for out-of-band model completions.
 *  - v6: `SyncMessage.planned` (ADR 0018) — the birth-fold exemption. Additive. (removed in v9)
 *  - v7: `PlanMessage.recalls` (`RecallOp`, ADR 0019) — conductor recall injects a folded
 *        block's full text at a stable tail anchor without unfolding it. Additive. (removed in v9)
 *  - (no bump, additive) `armed` / `armedAck`: the attached client declares its
 *    ARMED state over the wire (client→server `armed`), and the extension replies
 *    `armedAck` whenever it processes one. PROTOCOL_VERSION is DELIBERATELY NOT
 *    bumped here. Both live peers that carry the pi wire — the GUI (liveClient's
 *    hello handler) AND the bellows headless host — reject on a STRICT
 *    `protocolVersion !== PROTOCOL_VERSION` mismatch, not `>=`. A bump would break
 *    every mixed-version pairing (old GUI/host ↔ new extension, and vice versa) even
 *    though these two messages are purely additive: an old peer simply drops an
 *    unknown message type without error, degrading gracefully to the non-blocking
 *    fast path. Capability is detected out-of-band via `armedAck` — a new client
 *    that sends `armed` and gets no ack back knows it is talking to an old extension
 *    (and can scream) — so the version number buys nothing a bump would cost.
 *  - v8: `passthrough`: the extension's per-outcome ack for every `context` hook resolution
 *        (issue #60, ADR 0020) — `applied` / `empty-plan` / `timeout-stale` / `timeout-raw` /
 *        `epoch-mismatch`. The GUI tallies these into its "wire N/M" readout. The strict
 *        `protocolVersion !== PROTOCOL_VERSION` check both peers do refuses a pre-ack peer
 *        instead of pairing silently.
 *  - v9: birth folding (ADR 0018) and conductor recall (ADR 0019) were ripped out for
 *        simplification. `SyncMessage.planned`, `RecallOp`, `PlanMessage.recalls`, and
 *        `PassthroughMessage.recalls` are gone. The plan-applied ack (`passthrough`) and its
 *        cause taxonomy STAY — only their birth-fold/recall-specific fields and roles are
 *        removed. Bumped (never renumbered downward) so a stale client can't pair silently.
 *  - v10: conductor completion relay removed. `completeRequest` / `completeResult` (the
 *        out-of-band model-completion side channel) are gone along with the conductor
 *        subsystem. Everything else (sync/plan, unfold/recall, armed, passthrough) is unchanged.
