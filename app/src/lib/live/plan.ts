/*
 * plan.ts — turn the engine's LOCAL fold decisions into provider-safe wire ops.
 *
 * The engine (AccordionStore) already decides, per block, whether it is folded —
 * that is the brain. This module is the thin, PURE translation layer that mirrors
 * those decisions into the `FoldOp`s the GUI sends back to the pi extension over
 * the live link ("GUI drives, extension is thin"). No Svelte runes, no `$state`,
 * no side effects: given a store, it just reads and returns a plan.
 *
 * It emits one op per block that the store currently folds, BUT only after two
 * defense-in-depth filters on top of the extension's own `applyPlan` kind checks:
 *   • KIND filter — only `text | thinking | tool_result` are ever folded.
 *     A `tool_call` is never folded (altering/removing it orphans its result →
 *     provider 400); a `user` block (the human's intent) is never folded.
 *   • DURABLE-ID guard — only blocks with a durable, content-anchored id
 *     (`isDurableId`) are folded. A positional fallback id is not stable once the
 *     message array shifts (folding makes it non-append-only), so we must never
 *     instruct a fold we can't durably re-identify.
 * It also skips any op whose digest is empty, so a fold never empties a content
 * part. These checks duplicate the extension's safety net on purpose: both sides
 * enforce the invariant so neither alone is a single point of failure.
 *
 * Ops follow block order, matching the conversation's linear order.

/**
 * Resolve an agent `unfold` request against the live store (protocol v3). For each
 * `code` the agent sent (read from a `{#<code> FOLDED}` tag), restore EVERY folded
 * block carrying that code and record it; a code that matches no folded block is
 * reported in `missing`.
 *
 * Why all matches: the code is a short hash of the durable id (see `foldCode`), so it
 * can rarely collide. Restoring every folded block that shares the code is the cheap,
 * stateless way to handle that — an extra restored block is harmless (it only shows the
 * model more of its own content).
 *
 * Restoring uses `store.unfold(id, "agent")` — a sticky override (protected from
 * auto-refold) with provenance "agent" so the activity log shows the agent pulled it
 * back and the human stays the source of truth (free to re-fold it). Guarding on
 * `isFolded` is the safety pillar: the agent can only restore what was actually folded,
 * so it can never downgrade a human pin or flip an auto-managed block to a sticky
 * agent-unfold. It can request, never force. This MUTATES the store; the restored
 * content reaches the model at the next `context` hook (the block drops out of
 * `computeFoldOps`). Pure of the wire — the caller sends the result.

/**
 * Resolve an agent `recall` request against the live store (protocol v4, ADR 0011).

 * returns a folded block's ORIGINAL full content so the agent can use it THIS turn —
 * WITHOUT changing what is standing in its context. The block stays folded.
 *
 * Critical differences from `resolveUnfold`:
 *   • READ-ONLY — this NEVER calls `store.unfold`/`unfoldGroup`/any mutator. No override
 *     is created; the matched block remains folded exactly as it was. (This is why recall
 *     is never lockable: it can't alter the standing view, so it is the safe-by-construction
 *     read that keeps a locked `unfold` from blinding the agent.)
 *   • ORIGINAL content — for a matched block we return `store.get(id)?.text` (the full,
 *     un-folded content), NOT `store.digestOf(b)` (the lossy folded substitution). Returning
 *     the digest would defeat recall's whole purpose: the agent already SEES the digest.
 *
 * Same match set as `resolveUnfold` / `computeFoldOps`: folded + a `FOLDABLE_KIND` + a
 * durable id + `foldCode(b.id) === code` for per-block matches; also folded groups via
 * `foldCode(g.id) === code` (a group returns its members' full original text joined). A
