/*
 * foldAlarm.svelte.ts — the view↔wire divergence ALARM (indicator-only, never heals).
 *
 * The whole point of `wireFoldable` (engine/digest.ts) is that the screen can NEVER
 * show a per-block fold the agent's wire would refuse — the foldability gate lives in
 * ONE place and both `store.fold()`/`isFolded` AND `computeFoldOps` consult it. This
 * module is the BACKSTOP that watches for any residual divergence after those gates and
 * surfaces it as a single header dot. It is a tripwire, not a mechanism: it NEVER mutates
 * the store, NEVER throws, NEVER self-heals. In production it is purely an indicator; in
 * dev it additionally logs the first diverging block. If this alarm ever fires, a gate
 * upstream has a bug — fix the gate, never relax the alarm.
 *
 * THREE LAYERS (in order of severity):
 *
 *   1. UNIVERSAL (all modes) — a per-block fold that the wire's KIND gate would refuse.
 *      For every block that is NOT a collapsed folded-group member: if it reads folded in
 *      the view (`isFolded`) but `wireFoldable(b)` is false, that is a UI lie — a recessed
 *      tile / saved tokens for content the agent still receives whole. This should be
 *      impossible after the fold doors are gated on `wireFoldable`; the alarm is the
 *      "should never fire" proof. Folded-group members are EXCLUDED because group collapse
 *      (ADR 0006) is a SEPARATE structural mechanism that legitimately removes whole
 *      `tool_call`/`user` messages — a collapsed tool_call member is not a lie.
 *
 *   2. LIVE-ONLY — `viewSet` (per-block folds the view shows) vs `wireSet` (the per-block
 *      folds `computeFoldOps` produces) must be IDENTICAL. Note `computeFoldOps` is the
 *      WOULD-BE ARMED plan: when `folding.enabled` is off the agent's actual wire is empty,
 *      but the correct comparison is still the would-be plan, NOT the empty disarmed wire —
 *      per the CLAUDE.md rule, preview/listening must match what steering WOULD send, so a
 *      fold the armed plan would refuse is a lie even while disarmed. (That is why this layer
 *      gates on connection, not on `folding.enabled`.) The interesting residual case it
 *      catches: a foldable-kind block folded in the view but dropped by `computeFoldOps`
 *      because its id is non-durable (`isDurableId` false) — INTENDED to fire, since the view
 *      shows a fold steering would silently not perform. Gated to live because off-wire / demo
 *      / Claude-Code sessions use non-durable on-disk ids, so `computeFoldOps` is empty there
 *      and this check would false-positive on every fold (the id-format reconciliation that
 *      would let it run off-wire is deferred to Slice 2).
 *
 *   3. NOT VERIFIED (documented, deliberately) — folded-GROUP member balance (stragglers).
 *      The extension's `applyPlan` re-derives which group members are actually removed
 *      (balanced tool-pairs) against pi's live message array — which the APP does not have.
 *      So this alarm does NOT compare `computeGroupOps` member sets against the view; doing
 *      so naively would false-positive on every legitimate straggler. That divergence (a
 *      known ADR-0006 accounting gap) stays covered by the extension's last-resort structural
 *      guard and a deferred Slice 2. DO NOT "fix" this alarm by adding a group member
 *      comparison.
 *
 * O(n) over `store.blocks`. The writer takes `isLive` as an argument (not a `live`/`session`
 * import) to stay free of import cycles with the modules that drive it.
