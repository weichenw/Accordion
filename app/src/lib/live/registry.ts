/*
 * registry.ts — the session DISCOVERY contract for the "pull" connection model.
 *
 * In the pull model the pi extension does NOT spawn or push the GUI open. Instead,
 * each pi session advertises itself by writing a small descriptor file:
 *
 *   ~/.accordion/sessions/<sessionId>.json      (SessionEntry)
 *
 * refreshes it on a heartbeat while it lives, and deletes it on shutdown. The
 * Accordion app watches that directory and lists every live pi, so the user opens
 * ONE app and attaches to any session by clicking it. Liveness is read from the
 * heartbeat timestamp (a session whose heartbeat went stale is reaped).
 *
 * `/accordion` in a pi terminal additionally writes a single focus request:
 *
 *   ~/.accordion/focus.json                     (FocusRequest)
 *
 * which the app consumes (read-once, then delete) to foreground itself and select
 * that session. This remains the only session handoff path. `/accordion` may
 * best-effort launch/reinvoke the desktop app as a convenience, but the app still
 * discovers and pulls the session through this registry contract.
 *
 * This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the directory layout and the JSON
 * shapes. It is imported by:
 *   • the extension (Node) — which performs the writes using node:fs/os/path, and
 *   • the app (types only) — the Tauri Rust layer performs the reads and MUST
 *     mirror these constants (see app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs).
 *
 * Keep it dependency-free and runtime-pure: NO fs/os imports, so the browser
 * bundle can import the types without pulling in Node built-ins.
