## Positioning

Accordion exists because long AI sessions break. Hours into a debugging, research, or agent
session, a critical piece of context falls out of the window — the agent forgets a requirement
from the first message, and progress stalls. The common fix (silently summarize and discard old
turns) trades one kind of loss for another.

Accordion takes a different path: older context is **folded**, not deleted. It leaves the model's
active view without leaving the session. Every fold is reversible; every block is recoverable. The
wedge competitors can't claim: **nothing is lost.**

### Audience segments
- **Primary:** Programmers and heavy AI-chat users running hours-long coding, agent, and research sessions who need to manage a finite context window.
- **Secondary:** AI and agent engineers building products who need explicit, inspectable control over what the model can and can't see.
- **Anchor persona — "Three hours in":** a developer deep in a Claude Code / Cursor session who can't afford to lose the constraint they set in message one.

### Reference brands (borrow this)
- **Linear** — keyboard-first restraint; product-as-hero.
- **Vercel / Geist** — mono-meets-sans engineering rigor.
- **Raycast** — dark UI with a confident accent.
- **xAI** — stark, technical, near-monochrome calm.

## Foundation

**Mission:** Keep work alive across the length of a session — so progress never stalls because the agent forgot.

**Values**
1. **Durability** — Work should survive. Sessions are persistent, not disposable.
2. **Clarity** — No hidden behavior. You can always see what is folded, what is visible, and what the model currently holds.
3. **Trust** — Folding changes visibility, not ownership. The information remains available.

**Story.** You were three hours into a debugging session. The agent forgot the constraint from the
first message, and the work slowed to a crawl. That shouldn't happen. Accordion folds older context
instead of deleting it — recessed, reversible, never gone — and the colors of the context window fold
together into one continuous spectrum. The session continues.

## Voice & tone

**Adjectives:** Grounded · Direct · Calm · Confident · Practical.
We speak like an experienced engineer explaining a system to another engineer. We understand the
frustration of context loss but never dramatize it. We earn trust through clarity, not hype.

**Copy examples**
- Headline — "Fold context. Keep momentum."
- Body — "The fold is reversible. The information is still there — it just isn't in the model's active view."
- Button — "Fold older context" / "Unfold"
- Error — "Couldn't reach the session. Your folds are saved — nothing was lost. Retry when ready."

**Forbidden words:** powerful, seamless, leverage, AI-powered, intelligent, streamlined.
Replace marketing language with observable facts. If a claim can't be seen in the interface, cut it.

## Color

Monochrome base carries everything. Five **spectrum** colors name conversational block kinds; the
bolted system prompt uses a separate pale fixed-context yellow so its permanent floor reads apart
from the conversation. The spectrum hues still form the brand gradient, with indigo retained as its
bridge between user blue and thinking purple. Never set body text in a semantic hue, and never pair
two semantic hues as foreground/background. Maintain 4.5:1 contrast for body copy.

| Token | Hex | RGB | CMYK (approx) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ink | `#0A0A0A` | 10, 10, 10 | 0,0,0,96 | Primary text, logo |
| Charcoal | `#1C1C1C` | 28, 28, 28 | 0,0,0,89 | Dark surfaces, hero |
| Slate | `#4A4A4A` | 74, 74, 74 | 0,0,0,71 | Secondary text |
| Smoke | `#9A9A9A` | 154, 154, 154 | 0,0,0,40 | Labels, metadata, fold states |
| Cloud | `#E8E8E8` | 232, 232, 232 | 0,0,0,9 | Borders, dividers |
| Paper | `#F6F6F6` | 246, 246, 246 | 0,0,0,4 | Background surfaces |
| White | `#FFFFFF` | 255, 255, 255 | 0,0,0,0 | Base canvas |
| System | `#FFF6A4` | 255, 246, 164 | 0,4,36,0 | Block kind: bolted system prompt |
| User | `#044EFF` | 4, 78, 255 | 98,69,0,0 | Block kind: user message |

| Thinking | `#B480DF` | 180, 128, 223 | 19,43,0,13 | Block kind: thinking |
| Tool call | `#21D4C1` | 33, 212, 193 | 84,0,9,17 | Block kind: tool call |
| Tool result | `#E19C7D` | 225, 156, 125 | 0,31,44,12 | Block kind: tool result |

**Spectrum gradient:** `linear-gradient(90deg,#21D4C1 0%,#1AA6E8 30%,#044EFF 48%,#7D6EE6 64%,#B480DF 78%,#E19C7D 100%)`
Used as a soft, blended field over Ink (the "folded context" made visible). Keep it smoky, never a hard rainbow bar.

## Typography

- **IBM Plex Sans** — display + body. H1 46px/600/-2% tracking · H2 26px/600 · H3 22px/600 · Body 15px/400/1.6 (min 13px) · Caption 11px.
- **IBM Plex Mono** — data only: token counts, fold identifiers, context metrics, labels. Use sparingly; it signals data, not decoration.
- Google Fonts: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Sans:wght@400;500;600;700&family=IBM+Plex+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap`

## Logo

- **Symbol** — an accordion-bellows that doubles as the letter **A**: the instrument that folds, then reopens. Monochrome. Works 16px → 512px. Master art is **raster PNG** (transparent).
- **Wordmark** — "Accordion" set in **IBM Plex Sans Bold**.
- **Primary lockup** — symbol + ACCORDION, horizontal, balanced (neither element dominates).
- **App-icon / sticker tile** — the spectrum gradient on Ink with the white symbol centered, generous corner radius. The wordmark never appears inside the tile.
- **Clear space** — one full bellows-width around the lockup. **Never** stretch, rotate, recolor, shadow, or place on a low-contrast ground.

**Files** (`logo/`)
- `symbol/symbol-black.png` · `symbol/symbol-white.png` · `symbol/symbol-spectrum.png` (+ `.pdf` wrappers)
- `wordmark/wordmark-black.png` · `wordmark/wordmark-white.png`
- `lockup/horizontal/lockup-h-black.png` · `lockup/horizontal/lockup-h-white.png` (+ `.pdf` wrappers)

> Note: the symbol/lockup masters are PNG (the brand's existing art), not vector. The wordmark is type-set in IBM Plex Sans Bold and can be regenerated at any size.

## Photography

Real work, not productivity theater.
- **Subject:** late-night terminals, real desks, hands on keyboards, research in progress.
- **Light:** practical only — monitor glow, desk lamps, window light; natural shadows.
- **Color:** near-monochrome rooms; let the screen's spectrum glow be the only color.
- **Cast:** racially diverse, varied body types; subjects looking at the work, not the camera.
- **Texture:** film grain always; slight imperfection; found, not staged.
- **Never:** stock smiles, teams pointing at monitors, handshakes, neon cyberpunk, AI-smooth surfaces.

## Visual world
The unglamorous craft of long sessions — documentary, low-key, the screen the only source of color.

## Touchpoints
Desktop app on a real desk; the app on a phone; the developer's desk flat-lay; the mark as a die-cut sticker. On-screen UI shows the colored-block context grid.

---

## Do & Don't

**Do**
- Say what the interface does — "folded, not deleted," "reversible," "recoverable."
- Let the screen's spectrum be the only color; keep everything else Ink and Paper.
- Reserve each hue for its block kind — blue is the user, never a button.
- Show real product screenshots before any illustration.
- Give the wordmark a full bellows-width of clear space.

**Don't**
- Use hype ("powerful," "seamless," "intelligent," "streamlined").
- Recolor, rotate, stretch, or shadow the mark.
- Set body text in a spectrum hue or pair two hues as fg/bg.
- Dramatize context loss or imply anything was deleted.
- Crop the tagline mid-word or split "Your session, intact."

## How to use this spec
- **With AI tools:** paste `prompts/system-prompt.md` at the top of a thread, then a task starter from `prompts/`.
- **Developers:** import `tokens/tokens.css` (or `.json` / the Tailwind snippet) and the SVGs in `icons/`.
- **Designers:** fonts in `fonts/`, logos in `logo/`, full visual reference in `brand-guidelines.pdf`.
- **Favicon →** `logo/symbol/symbol-black.png` (light) / `symbol-white.png` (dark). **App icon →** `symbol-spectrum.png`. **Web header →** a lockup PNG. **Print →** the `.pdf` wrappers.
