/*
 * ops.ts — the FROZEN Op vocabulary + clamp/txn result shapes.
 *
 * `Truth.apply(ops, by, baseRev?)` is the single write path for every overlay mutation —
 * human, agent, and strategy alike. An `Op` is a declarative request; `Truth` applies it
 * atomically-per-op with clamping, never throwing on bad input, and returns one `OpResult`
 * per op describing exactly what happened.
 *
 * The `by: Actor` argument to `apply` (NOT carried on the op) decides authority:
 *   • "you"   — a human hand action. Sets `override`; gated by the `human-steering` lock.
 *   • "agent" — the live agent's `unfold` tool. Gated by the `agent-unfold` lock.
 *   • "auto"  — an attached context strategy. Sets `autoFolded`/`subst`, leaves `override`
 *     null, and is clamped by any human override (never the reverse).
