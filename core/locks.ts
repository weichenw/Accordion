/*
 * locks.ts — the involvement-lock vocabulary (ADR 0011).
 *
 * An involvement lock lets a context-management strategy take UNCONTESTED control of a
 * specific steering control: while a lock is held, the human (or the agent) can no longer
 * reach in and override that control by hand. "Human overrides always win" becomes "human
 * overrides win for every control the holder did NOT lock." Trust moves from *override* to
 * *revocability* — you can always take the keys back (the conductor host's kill switch), you
 * just can't surgically fight a locked control mid-run.
 *
 * Only STEERING — actions that change the agent's context — is ever lockable. The sacred
 * tier is NEVER lockable in any way: observation (peek / the live map / the activity log /
 * the budget readout), the budget dial, the agent's `recall`, and detach. Locking is about
 * *touching*, never *seeing*.
 *
 * This module is deliberately dependency-free and runes-free — it defines the vocabulary the
 * Truth core gates on and the conductor host drives. The lock STATE (which locks are held, by
 * whom, with what tail) lives on the Truth instance (`Truth.setLocks/clearLocks`); this file
 * is only the names + predicates.
 *
 * HISTORY: this vocabulary previously lived in the (removed) conductor contract, then in the
 * app engine; it now lives in the framework-free `core/` package so the app AND the extension
 * gate on one definition. NO conductor object holds a lock in Phase A — locks are set
 * programmatically via `Truth.setLocks`/`clearLocks`; the conductor host drives that API.

/**
 * The three steering controls a holder may take EXCLUSIVE control of (ADR 0011 §2):
 *
 *  - `human-steering` — the human's hand fold / unfold / pin / unpin / group / reset. Under
 *    this lock every human steering entry point is refused by the engine (no override is ever
 *    created), and the human's only recourse is to release the lock.
 *  - `agent-unfold` — the agent's `unfold` tool (forcing a folded block standing-open). A
 *    SEPARATE axis from `human-steering`: a holder can lock the human and leave the agent
 *    free, or the reverse, or both. The agent's `recall` is NOT gated by this (it is sacred),
 *    so locking `agent-unfold` never blinds the agent — it only stops it from *forcing* a
 *    block to stand open against the strategy.
 *  - `tail-size` — the protected-tail dial (`setProtect`) AND the tail's no-fold floor. Under
 *    this lock the human can no longer resize the tail and the host stops treating the
 *    protected tail as an absolute floor; the holder declares how much tail it wants via
 *    `tailTokens` (`0` ⇒ own the whole context, no protected tail; `> 0` ⇒ protect the newest
 *    ~N tokens, which stay unfoldable).
