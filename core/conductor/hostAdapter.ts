/*
 * hostAdapter.ts — framework-free, dependency-free derivation of `HostEvent`s (the frozen
 * conductor-v2 contract, `./contract`) from a `Truth` and its `TruthEvent`s (`../events`).
 *
 * `TestHost` (`./testhost.ts`) was, until Phase C, the ONLY place this derivation existed — every
 * shipped conductor (`conductors/in-process/**`, `conductors/ws/thermocline/**`) is golden-tested against
 * exactly what TestHost derives. Phase C needs the SAME derivation in two more places (the
 * in-extension live host, the out-of-process remote SDK), so it is extracted here rather than
 * re-derived — a second hand-rolled copy would risk drifting from what those conductors were
 * validated against. `TestHost` now consumes these functions instead of its own private copies.
 *
 * Every export here is a pure function of its arguments (plus read-only `Truth` queries) — no
 * subscriptions, no side effects, no host-lifecycle state. A host wires these into its own
 * `Truth.onEvent` subscription and its own `fire`/`listeners` plumbing.
