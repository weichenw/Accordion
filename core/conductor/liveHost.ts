/*
 * liveHost.ts — `LiveConductorHost`, the in-extension host that attaches a resident conductor to
 * the authoritative live Truth (Phase C).
 *
 * It plays two roles at once:
 *   1. A `ConductorHost` (the frozen conductor-v2 contract, `./contract`) handed to an IN-PROCESS
 *      conductor's `attach(host)` — `on` / `get` / `blocks` / `groups` / `textOf` / `stats` /
 *      `countTokens` / `digestOf` / `complete` / `setStatus` / `propose`, all reading/writing the
 *      one live Truth.
 *   2. The lifecycle host that the SAME contract's moments (turn-committed, wire-departing, resync,
 *      recall) reach a REMOTE (spawned) conductor over the wire — a remote conductor is a replica
 *      that derives blocks-appended/state-changed/resync from the normal event stream it already
 *      receives, so only `wireDeparting` and `turnCommitted` need explicit sends.
 *
 * Fully dependency-injected (`LiveHostDeps`) so it unit-tests with a mock Truth + mock sockets +
 * mock spawn, no WebSocket / child process / pi in sight.
 *
 * The single derivation of `HostEvent`s from the Truth is REUSED from `./hostAdapter` (never
 * re-derived) — the same functions `TestHost` and every shipped conductor are golden-tested against.

	 *    Release is tied to the handler's returned promise SETTLING.
	 *  - REMOTE: send `wireDeparting` (carrying a unique `holdId`), then resolve when the conductor
	 *    sends `holdRelease { holdId }` — which the SDK emits the moment its handler settles, exactly
	 *    mirroring the in-process semantics — raced against the timeout. A `propose` no longer releases
	 *    the hold (P1-2): a concurrent background-tick propose used to race the hold and release it
	 *    before the handler's last-moment fold landed.
	 *
	 * The `holdId` doubles as the generation guard: a stale/unknown `holdRelease` (or a timed-out
	 * hold's late release) never resolves a later hold. `lastHoldMs` is recorded each call; a timeout
	 * increments `holdTimeouts`.
	 *
	 * Fix 4: the IN-PROCESS race now has a THIRD arm — `inProcessHoldRelease` — that `detachActive`
	 * fires unconditionally (via `releaseHold`, same as the remote path already did through
	 * `holdWaiter`). Previously a detach mid-hold left this function blocked until the handler's promise
	 * settled or `holdWireUpToMs` elapsed, even though nothing was listening anymore. A detach that wins
	 * the race is not a timeout (no `holdTimeouts` bump) — see the `this.active` guard on `lastHoldMs`

	 * set there (the same "no phantom hold" invariant `detachActive`'s own comment documents).
