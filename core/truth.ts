/*
 * truth.ts — the Truth class: Accordion's canonical context state, framework-free.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for a session's context: the append-only block log, the
 * per-block overlay (override / autoFolded / subst / by), the multiblock groups, the protected
 * working tail, the involvement locks, and the budget/context-window dials. It owns ALL the
 * fold/group/protect logic — the app's Svelte store is a thin reactive MIRROR over it, and in
 * Phase B this exact class runs authoritatively inside the pi extension.
 *
 * The single write path is `apply(ops, by, baseRev?)`. Config dials have their own evented
 * setters. Every state change bumps a monotonic `rev` and emits one `TruthEvent`; subscribers
 * (`onEvent`) project those into whatever reactive/wire form they need.
 *
 * No Svelte, no runes, no runtime dependencies — plain TypeScript.

	 * WHY this must call the wire's OWN function and never a re-derived approximation: the floor's
	 * verdict for one run depends on global context — which OTHER runs (this group's or another
	 * group's) survive, degrade, or vanish right next to it — exactly the cross-run cascade
	 * `computeDegradedDropRuns` already implements for `applyPlan`. Re-deriving an "equivalent"

	 * cascaded chain of drops), and drift between the wire and the accounting is precisely the bug
	 * this method exists to close — the UI's claimed savings would once again lie about what the

	 * inputs in, same verdict out, whether that function runs inside `applyPlan` (host, real

	 * class produced it (`wireRoleOfId`, the inverse of `blockId`'s prefix scheme), so the needed
	 * `WireMsgShape[]` is reconstructed from `blockLog` alone (`buildWireShapes`), same for the
	 * host and a replica that only ever adopted a snapshot.
	 *
	 * PERFORMANCE: one O(blockCount) pass to reconstruct `WireMsgShape[]` plus `computeGroupOps()`
	 * (O(foldedGroups), already paid by `serializeWire` on the host) — no worse an order than the
	 * O(blockCount) `liveTokens()`/`fullTokens()` passes this same rev change already triggers, and
