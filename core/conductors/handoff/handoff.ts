/*
 * core/conductors/handoff/handoff.ts — the "Handoff (fresh start)" conductor.
 *
 * PORTED from the deleted `conductors/handoff/handoff.ts` (ADR 0017, git rev dc037bc) onto the
 * conductor-v2 contract, via the `ViewConductor` adapter (`core/conductor/view.ts`). Since that
 * port, PR #82 factored the ~90%-duplicated machinery it shared with the sibling
 * `compaction-naive` conductor into `../agedSummaryConductor.ts`'s `AgedSummaryConductor` base
 * class (aged-region derivation, foreign-grouped-id exclusion, group emission, completion
 * launch/inflight/attempt-key/sticky-status lifecycle, the output-token reservation math, and the
 * prompt-injection-neutralizing `<conversation>`/`<previous-handoff>` template). This file now owns
 * only what is genuinely different: `HANDOFF_SYSTEM`, the two `buildPrompt` instruction strings,
 * the count-preamble format, the three status messages (this one alone surfaces the provider's
 * real error text — see `rejectMessage`), and the `tail-size` lock / `HANDOFF_TAIL_TOKENS = 0`
 * declaration that makes a handoff cover the WHOLE session rather than only the aged prefix.
 *
 * Both this conductor and `compaction-naive` swallow every kind — including `user` — into their
 * respective groups; neither overrides `includeInGroup` (see `../agedSummaryConductor.ts`'s default
 * — every kind — and `compaction-naive.ts`'s banner PARITY NOTE for why an earlier, since-reverted
 * `user`-exclusion override briefly made them differ). There is no remaining behavioral fork there.
 *
 * PURPOSE (unchanged): automatically simulate the user's manual handoff workflow:
 *   1. Ask the current agent to write a handoff document.
 *   2. Kill / clear the current session.
 *   3. Start a new session that receives only that handoff document.
 *
 * The conductor does that without writing a file. It calls the live model out-of-band with a
 * prompt that mirrors the local `handoff` skill (except the mktemp/save-to-file clause is
 * replaced with inline output), then replaces the whole current session with the returned handoff
 * document. The successor context is the handoff plus future post-handoff turns — no verbatim
 * old-session tail.
 *
 * MECHANICS: this is implemented as one folded `group` whose digest is the handoff text. The
 * group is intentionally non-recoverable from the agent's perspective (no `{#code FOLDED}` tag),
 * because a fresh session cannot unfold the killed session's transcript. The human can still
 * DETACH in Accordion to recover full history; that is the UI escape hatch, not part of the
 * simulated agent workflow.
 *
 * `tail-size` is locked with `tailTokens = 0` so the host protects no old-session blocks from the
 * handoff. Subsequent handoffs are written from the prior handoff plus new work only, just like a
 * real chain of handoff documents.
 *
 * Like `compaction-naive`, this conductor swallows `user` blocks into the group along with every
 * other kind (`includeInGroup` is not overridden — see `../agedSummaryConductor.ts`'s default). For
 * a handoff that is the whole product: "collapse the ENTIRE prior session, including what the
 * human asked for, into one prose document a fresh agent reads instead" — gated behind an explicit
 * ALL-THREE-LOCKS consent (`human-steering` + `agent-unfold` + `tail-size`), unlike
 * `compaction-naive`'s two-lock, budget-driven, otherwise-invisible foil. A user ask surviving only
 * in paraphrased form inside the handoff document is the intended mechanism here. See
 * `handoff.test.ts`'s zero-tail test and this file's `locks`/`tailTokens` for the consent shape.
 *
 * PORT FIDELITY — real adaptations, not cosmetic renames:
 *
 *   1. Everything the `AgedSummaryConductor` base now owns (`../agedSummaryConductor.ts`'s own
 *      banner documents these in full): no `host.can()` pre-flight; `this.rerun()` in place of the
 *      old `host.requestRerun()`; the raw trigger baseline reconstructed from
 *      `sumTokens(view.blocks)` rather than `view.liveTokens`; `foreignGroupedIds()` in place of
 *      the blanket `ViewBlock.grouped`; and the sticky reject/empty-output/window-too-tight status.
 *      These were originally documented per-conductor (this file first established the fix
 *      pattern that `compaction-naive`'s port followed); they now live once, in the base class.
 *
 *   2. `agedRegion`'s CUMULATIVE re-surfacing of this conductor's own prior group members (because
 *      `tailTokens = 0` makes the aged region the whole session) means `launchCompletion`'s
 *      `agedBlocks` snapshot is already the correct cumulative set on every round — no separate
 *      accumulation bookkeeping needed. `handedOffIds = launchedAgedIds` (now `this.coveredIds =
 *      launchedAgedIds` in the base) is a correct wholesale replace for the same reason it always
 *      was.
 *
 * Everything else — `HANDOFF_SYSTEM`, both `buildPrompt` instruction strings, the
 * `neutralizeSentinels` sentinel defense (now `neutralizeClosingTags` in the shared base, with this
 * file's own zero-arg `neutralizeSentinels` kept as a thin wrapper pinned to this conductor's own
 * tag set so existing call sites/tests are untouched), the sticky `failureStatus` (now the base
 * class's), the `lastAttemptKey` retry gate, and the stale-completion guard (controller identity)
 * — is ported/kept unchanged.
 *
 * No Svelte, no `$state`, no engine imports. Types only from `../../conductor/contract` and
 * `../agedSummaryConductor`.

/**
 * The inherited old-session tail this conductor OWNS via the `tail-size` lock. A literal fresh
 * start keeps NONE of the old session verbatim: the successor agent receives the handoff document
 * and only future post-handoff turns. `0` makes the host drive `protectedFromIndex` to
 * `blocks.length` (see `Truth.computeProtectedFromIndex`), so every current block is eligible to
 * be folded into the handoff group.
 *
 * NOTHING applies `locks`/`tailTokens` to `Truth` today — the new contract's host (Phase C, not yet
 * built) owns turning a conductor's declared `locks`/`tailTokens` into an actual
 * `Truth.setLocks(...)` call on attach/detach. This conductor only declares the intent; tests drive
 * `Truth.setLocks` directly to simulate what that host will eventually do (see `handoff.test.ts`).
 *
 * WHY IT STAYS ZERO EVEN WHILE IDLE (accepted residual, ADR 0017 §"Hardening", item 4 — ported,
 * still applies under the new contract, UNCHANGED by the port or by PR #82's extraction). Ideally
 * the zero tail would apply only while a handoff fold is actually in effect, and the human's
 * default tail floor would stand during the long ramp to the 0.9 trigger. That is not expressible
 * from the conductor side: `tailTokens` is a static declaration read once by whatever attaches this
 * conductor (the future Phase C host — same as the OLD host's `store.svelte.ts → syncLocks`, called
 * only from `attach()`/`reconcileLocks()`, never per `conduct()` pass), not a per-`conduct()`-pass
 * input — a getter that varied per pass would never take effect, and a non-zero value would clamp
 * the first handoff group `invalid-group` out of the newest blocks and leak raw old-session context
 * (breaking ADR 0017 §1 fidelity). Per-pass tail sizing needs a host change, out of scope for this
 * port. The residual is BENIGN for the wire: on every no-handoff path (below trigger, in-flight,
 * decline, empty/failed completion) the conductor emits `[]` or the prior handoff group, so the
 * session ships RAW — full content, nothing folded, zero data loss.
