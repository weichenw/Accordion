/*
 * protocol.ts — the Phase-B wire contract between the pi extension and Accordion clients.
 *
 * Framework-free, dependency-free, types-only at runtime. Lives in `core/` so BOTH the
 * authoritative Truth host (the extension) and every replica client (the GUI) import ONE
 * definition and can never drift. `app/src/lib/live/protocol.ts` is a re-export shim.
 *
 * ── Phase B model (the truth moved into the extension) ──────────────────────────────
 * The extension hosts an authoritative `Truth` per session. pi's `context` hook is now a
 * LOCAL operation against that in-process Truth — there is no 250ms plan round trip. A
 * client is a REPLICA + remote control:
 *
 *   1. connect → `hello` (protocol version, session meta, accepted role).
 *   2. `snapshot` — full serialized state; the client builds a rev-aligned replica Truth.
 *   3. `event` — a REPLAYABLE INPUT (append / ops / config / locks / sent / reset), each
 *      stamped with the host's post-mutation `rev`. The replica replays the input through
 *      its own Truth and asserts `replica.rev === event.rev`; a mismatch ⇒ request a fresh
 *      snapshot. Events carry inputs, never derived state (Phase A review).
 *   4. `command` (client→server) — the client NEVER mutates optimistically. It sends ops /
 *      config dials; the host applies them to the authoritative Truth (which emits events to
 *      ALL clients) and replies `commandResult`. The loopback echo is sub-millisecond, so the
 *      replica mutates ONLY via the event stream — no double-apply reconciliation.
 *
 * unfold / recall are resolved LOCALLY against the host Truth (they work with zero clients),
 * so their old request/result round-trip message types are gone. Telemetry (`telemetry`)
 * replaces the plan-outcome ack: it streams the `context` hook duration after every hook.
 *
 * History:
 *  - v4–v10: the "GUI drives, extension is thin" plan-round-trip protocol (sync/plan,
 *    unfoldRequest/Result, recallRequest/Result, armed/armedAck, passthrough). All removed.
 *  - v11: Phase B. The extension is authoritative. `hello`/`snapshot`/`event`/`telemetry`/
 *    `commandResult`/`folding`/`recall`/`stream` (server→client) and `command`
 *    (client→server). PROTOCOL_VERSION bumped so a pre-B client cannot pair silently — both
 *    peers reject on a strict `protocolVersion !== PROTOCOL_VERSION`.
 *  - v12: `SnapshotState` gained `birthFolded`. Without it, a replica hydrated after a
 *    birth-fold started with an empty birth-fold set, so its very next housekeep healed the
 *    block locally while the host kept it folded — a silent divergence `rev` bookkeeping alone
 *    couldn't catch (both sides still bump by exactly one). Bumped so a pre-v12 peer (which
 *    would silently drop the field) cannot pair with a v12 host/client that assumes it's there.
 *  - v13: Phase C groundwork. A second client `Role` — `"conductor"` — can now attach as a
 *    RESIDENT strategy (in-extension live host or an out-of-process remote SDK) instead of a
 *    passive GUI replica: `hello` advertises the catalog of available conductors
 *    (`HelloMessage.conductors`); `conductorState`/`conductorStatus` broadcast to every client;
 *    `wireDeparting`/`turnCommitted` notify the attached conductor of the same host-lifecycle
 *    moments `TestHost.departWire`/`commitTurn` fire in-process; `propose`/`proposeResult` and
 *    `completeRequest`/`completeResult` carry the conductor's `ConductorHost.propose`/`complete`
 *    calls over the wire; `setConductorStatus` carries `ConductorHost.setStatus`; `WireCommand`
 *    gains `selectConductor` (GUI picker → host attach/detach). Bumped so a pre-v13 peer (which
 *    has none of this vocabulary) cannot pair with a v13 host/client that assumes it's there.
